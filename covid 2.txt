Step-by-step Explanation
🧰 1️⃣ Install and Set Up Hadoop
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk -y


Updates your package list and installs Java 11, which Hadoop requires to run.

wget https://downloads.apache.org/hadoop/common/hadoop-3.3.6/hadoop-3.3.6.tar.gz
tar -xvzf hadoop-3.3.6.tar.gz
sudo mv hadoop-3.3.6 /usr/local/hadoop


Downloads Hadoop 3.3.6

Extracts it

Moves it into /usr/local/hadoop for system-wide access

⚙️ 2️⃣ Start Hadoop Services
start-dfs.sh
start-yarn.sh


start-dfs.sh: starts HDFS (NameNode + DataNode)

start-yarn.sh: starts YARN (resource manager + node manager)

📂 3️⃣ Create a Directory and Upload Data into HDFS
hdfs dfs -mkdir /covid_data
hdfs dfs -put covid_dataset.csv /covid_data/
hdfs dfs -ls /covid_data


Creates a folder /covid_data in HDFS

Uploads your covid_dataset.csv into that folder

Lists the contents to confirm upload

🐝 PART 2: Hive Commands (SQL on Hadoop)

Hive allows you to query large datasets stored in Hadoop using an SQL-like syntax.

🧩 Step-by-step Explanation
🗄️ 1️⃣ Create and Use Database
CREATE DATABASE covid_analysis;
USE covid_analysis;


Creates a new database covid_analysis

Switches Hive context to that database

🧾 2️⃣ Create Table Structure
CREATE TABLE covid_data (
  Date STRING,
  Country STRING,
  Continent STRING,
  TotalCases INT,
  TotalDeaths INT,
  TotalRecovered INT,
  Vaccinated INT
)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
STORED AS TEXTFILE;


Defines a table schema for your dataset

The table expects comma-separated text files (CSV format)

The data will be read from HDFS storage

📤 3️⃣ Load Data into Hive Table
LOAD DATA INPATH '/covid_data/covid_dataset.csv' INTO TABLE covid_data;


Loads the CSV file from HDFS path (/covid_data/) into the Hive table

Hive does not copy the data; it references it from HDFS

📊 4️⃣ Run Hive Queries (SQL Analysis)

1️⃣ Global total infections

SELECT SUM(TotalCases) AS GlobalInfected FROM covid_data;


→ Returns the total number of cases across all countries.

2️⃣ Cases per Continent

SELECT Continent, SUM(TotalCases) AS Cases FROM covid_data GROUP BY Continent;


→ Groups data by continent and sums total cases per group.

3️⃣ Country with Maximum Deaths

SELECT Country, MAX(TotalDeaths) AS MaxDeaths FROM covid_data;


→ Finds the country with the highest death count.

4️⃣ Total Vaccinated People

SELECT SUM(Vaccinated) AS TotalVaccinated FROM covid_data;


→ Sums up all vaccinated numbers globally.
